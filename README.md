## Setup and Run Instructions

To set up and run the Q&A Bot application locally, follow these steps:

- **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
 git clone <repository-url>
```

- **Navigate to Project Directory:**

```bash
 cd q-and-a-bot
```

- **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
 npm install
```

- **Set Up Environment Variables:**
  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

- **Run the Application:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

- **Access the Application:**
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Overview of Application Features

Q&A Bot is a simple web-based application that allows users to ask questions and receive answers generated by an AI model. Here's an overview of its features:

- **Ask Questions:** Users can input their questions in a text field provided on the homepage.
- **Get Answers:** Upon submitting a question, the application sends the question to the AI model/API and displays the generated answer.
- **Try Again:** Users have the option to ask another question by clicking the "Try again" button.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive and works well on various screen sizes.

## Information on AI Model or API Used

Q&A Bot utilizes the GPT-3.5-turbo model provided by OpenAI. This model is a state-of-the-art language model capable of generating human-like responses based on given prompts. The application communicates with the OpenAI API to generate answers to user questions.

## How to Test

To run the tests for the Q&A Bot application, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

This command will execute all the tests and provide you with the test results.

### Testing Environment Configuration

Depending on the type of test you are running, you may need to configure the testing environment accordingly.

- **For API Handler Tests:**

  - If you are testing the API handler (e.g., completion.test.ts), ensure that the test environment is set to node.
  - To configure the test environment for API handler tests:
    - Open jest.config.ts.
    - Set the testEnvironment option to node.

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    // Other Jest configurations...
    testEnvironment: "node",
  };
  ```

- **For UI Component Tests:**

  - If you are testing UI components (e.g., index.test.tsx), ensure that the test environment is set to jsdom.
  - To configure the test environment for UI component tests:
    - Open jest.config.ts.
    - Set the testEnvironment option to jsdom.

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    // Other Jest configurations...
    testEnvironment: "jsdom",
  };
  ```

  By configuring the test environment appropriately, you ensure that the tests run smoothly and accurately reflect the behavior of the application.
